  # Class SummaryResponse represents server response on +summary+ Search API
  # request. Server response is sent to initializer which creates object with
  # attributes +totals+, +execTimeMs+ accessible via getters:
  # * +totals+
  # * +execTimeMs+
  # * +exec_time_ms+
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #  response = SummaryResponse.new("totals" => 20, "execTimeMs" => 100)
  #  response.totals       # => 20
  #  response.execTimeMs   # => 100
  #  response.exec_time_ms # => 100
  #
  class SummaryResponse < Struct.new(:totals, :execTimeMs) do
      def exec_time_ms
        execTimeMs
      end
    end
  end
