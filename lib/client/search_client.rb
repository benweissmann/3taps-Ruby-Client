module ThreeTaps
  # The SearchClient class allows clients to query 3taps Search API for data,
  # and data about data.
  #
  # Its methods are used to query API with appropriate requests:
  #  client = SearchClient.new
  #  client.search(search_request)    # => returns array of SearchResponse objects
  #  client.range(range_request)      # => returns array of RangeResponse objects
  #  client.summary(summary_request)  # => returns array of SummaryResponse objects
  #  client.count(search_request)     # => returns array of CountResponse objects
  #  client.best_match(keywords)      # => returns array of BestMatchResponse objects
  class SearchClient < Client

    # Method +search+ searches 3taps for postings. Example:
    #
    #  request = SearchRequest.new
    #  client = SearchClient.new
    #  client.search(request)     # => SearchResponse
    #
    def search(search_request)
      response = execute_get("/search", search_request.query_params)
      SearchResponse.new(decode(response))
    end

    # Method +range+ returns the minium and maximum values currently in 3taps for
    # the given fields that match the given Common Search Criteria inside of the
    # RangeResponse object. The purpose of the range method is to provide
    # developers with sensible values for range-based UI filters.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #  request = RangeRequest.new
    #  client = SearchClient.new(request)
    #  client.range(request)        # => RangeResponse
    #
    def range(range_request)
      response = execute_get("/search/range", range_request.query_params)
      RangeResponse.from_array(decode(response))
    end

    # Method +summary+ returns the total number of postings found in 3taps, across
    # the given dimension, that match the given Common Search Criteria parameters
    # inside of the SummaryResponse object. Searching for "text=toyota" across
    # "dimension=source" would return a list of all sources in 3taps, along with
    # the number of postings matching the search "text=toyota" in that source.
    # You may currently search across dimensions source, category, and location.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #  request = SummaryRequest.new
    #  client = SearchClient.new
    #  client.summary(request)      # => SummaryResponse
    #
    def summary(summary_request)
      response = execute_get("/search/summary", summary_request.query_params)
      SummaryResponse.from_hash(decode(response))
    end

    # Method +count+ returns the total number of postings that match the given
    # Common Search Criteria represented by SearchRequest. Example:
    #
    #  request = SearchRequest.new
    #  client = SearchClient.new
    #  client.count(request)      # => CountResponse
    #
    def count(search_request)
      response = execute_get("/search/count", search_request.query_params)
      CountResponse.new(decode(response))
    end

    # Method +best_match+ returns the 3taps category associated with the keywords,
    # along with the number of postings in that category. Example:
    #
    #  keywords = "iPad,Apple,iPhone"
    #  client = SearchClient.new
    #  client.best_match(keywords)     # => BestMatchResponse
    # 
    def best_match(keywords)
      response = execute_get("/search/best-match", "keywords=#{keywords}")
      BestMatchResponse.new(decode(response))
    end
